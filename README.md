# Goldman_Sachs_Task

The points which I developed during my short period.
- Dark mode support.
- Dynamic Networking manager classes.
- Rest API calling and transfer the response objects into Model classes.
- Actually, in API response only I am getting single objects at a time.
- So, I would have to manage the model classes with multi objects as well as single objects.
- For the Favorite and Unfavorite features I implemented the SQLite database for that.
- For offline app work is also implemented.
- Search with a particular date too, but the date format must and should be YYYY-MM-DD.
- Video loading was also implemented.
- Even if the media type is video then I have given the expand option as well on that cell.
- Other than that I have been take care of all the standards for the development phase.
- Manage and see regarding the app smoothness, standard coding structure, etc.

About the Framework, Library, and classes
- For networking, I used Alamofire and ReachabilitySwift.
- SQLite database I have added my custom classes for all SQL queries statement that are developed in Objective C.
- Other than For Video display and play I have used AVFoundation.
- For expanding the video cell with another screen I have used the third-party classes.
- For the URL image loading I have created the classes for that and cached the image with the URL name.
